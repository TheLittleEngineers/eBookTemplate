# eBookTemplate
 (Deprecated - As It Turns Out - It Is Easier To Create A Kible Publication WITHOUT A Template) - This is a set of eBook Templates intended to ease the construction of Kindle, PDF and Generic eBooks. They are intended to be ALL INCLUSIVE, containing all possible sections of a book and their descriptions, allowing them to be removed or added, at will and as needed. We will also offer the service of helping to prepare your book for publication if you should require such a service.
